This is a /* begginer */ Android Mobile Platform App called " Quick Notes " , which is basically a notes app. It can make new notes, update those if you needed and delete them.
It has a full fuctioning CRUD with SQ Lite as it's DataBase.
The App is very basic interms of UI elements : An opening Splash screen with an animation, simple elements that represents CRUD, a confirmation pop-up for delete function.
Last version that I have made this one is :- Android Studio :: Jellyfish(version).
